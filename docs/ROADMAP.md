# Roadmap

LibretroWebXR is a **browser-based, WebXR libretro frontend** that runs retro
emulators inside a 3D room, on desktop browsers and standalone Quest, with no
install. The north star is an **open, web-native EmuVR**: build your own room,
curate game collections, share rooms as data, and eventually play together.

See `docs/EMUVR_RESEARCH.md` for what we're modelling on,
`docs/ROOM_AND_COLLECTIONS.md` for the room/collection JSON system,
`docs/MULTIPLAYER.md` for the netcode plan, and `docs/LICENSING.md` for the
"fetch cores, ship no ROMs" policy.

## Current state (inherited prototype — already working)

This is **not** a greenfield plan; a working app was carried over (see
`PROVENANCE.md`). It already has:

- Three.js + WebXR scene with an enclosed 3D room (`SceneMgr`, `CrtShader`).
- libretro cores driven directly (main-thread `<script>` + dynamic `import()`
  for MODULARIZE cores), rendering onto a CRT/TV mesh (`EmulatorClient`).
- A VR room: grabbable **cartridges** on a **shelf**, a **console**, a
  **gamepad**, a **memory card**, with grab + locomotion (`Cartridge`, `Shelf`,
  `Console`, `Gamepad`, `MemoryCard`, `GrabMgr`, `LocomotionMgr`).
- Input across keyboard / gamepad / WebXR controllers with per-core, two-hand
  RetroPad mapping (`InputMgr`, `GameInputMgr`, `ControllerMaps`,
  `ControlsPanel`).
- Save states (`SaveState`), spatial audio (`SpatialAudio`), in-VR menus
  (`MenuMgr`, `MenuPanel`), a debug HUD, and a `?core=` override.
- ~13 systems wired (SNES, NES, Atari 2600, Genesis/SMS/GG, GBA, Virtual Boy,
  PC Engine, C64, VIC-20) via the `CORES` map.
- COOP/COEP for SharedArrayBuffer (`vite.config.js`, `deploy/`), and a puppeteer
  health-check harness (`scripts/debug.js`, `DEBUGGING.md`).

So the foundation EmuVR took years to build (room + emulator-on-a-TV + grabbable
games) largely exists. The roadmap is about **making it open, declarative, and
multiplayer** — EmuVR's strengths — while keeping our advantages (browser,
Quest-native, shareable-as-data).

## Phase 0 — Publish the clean repo  ✅ (this commit)
Clean re-home, MIT license, licensing docs, EmuVR research, this roadmap, a
core-fetch script, and free test ROMs. Initialize git; push to a host.

## Phase R — Rooms & Collections as JSON  ← next
Turn today's imperative scene-building into a declarative layer (no rewrite).
- `src/systems.js` — system-first registry (label, default/allowed cores, exts,
  folder aliases, thumbnail repo). Refactor of the `CORES` map.
- `Collection` loader — superset of today's `manifest.json`
  (`*.collection.json`, see `docs/ROOM_AND_COLLECTIONS.md`).
- `RomResolver` — url / local (File System Access API) / pick / opfs sources.
  This delivers the user goal: reference **web folders** *or* **local folders on
  PCs/headsets**.
- `ArtResolver` — libretro-thumbnails fallback chain (filename → title →
  tag-stripped).
- `RoomLoader` — reads `*.room.json`, drives the existing factories
  (`createShelf/Cartridge/Console/...`), applies surfaces/lighting.
- Load room/collection by `?room=URL` / drag-drop. **Acceptance:** a shared
  `.room.json` URL reconstructs a room + collection on another machine; free
  games play, owned games show empty slots.

## Phase E — In-VR room editor
Place/rotate props, swap wallpaper/floor/posters, assign collections to shelves,
add **portals** to other rooms — all writing back to `*.room.json`. Export/share
a room. This is the open, declarative replacement for EmuVR's closed WIGUx mod.

## Phase M — Multiplayer (see `docs/MULTIPLAYER.md`)
- **M0:** shared room presence — avatars + voice + room-object sync (works for
  all cores). Signaling/matchmaking server + TURN.
- **M1:** host-authoritative game sync (input + video stream) for 2-player.
- **M2:** rollback game sync for deterministic cores (adapt netplayjs +
  `SaveState`).
- **M3:** multiple simultaneous games, mid-session join, VR↔desktop crossplay.

## Phase C — Content & polish
- Documented open prop package schema (model + `prop.json`) — vs EmuVR's
  Discord-gated UGC kit.
- Community gallery of room/collection URLs.
- BIOS-needing systems (PSX/N64) via fetched cores; user-supplied BIOS UX.
- PWA install; per-headset storage UX; performance passes on Quest.

## Cross-cutting principles
- **Ship no ROMs, bundle no cores** (`docs/LICENSING.md`).
- **Rooms/collections are portable JSON**, content referenced by location.
- **Don't rewrite the working core** — add declarative layers over existing
  factories.
- **Quest + desktop parity** is a release gate, not an afterthought.
